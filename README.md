## üö® Portfolio Scenario: Responding to a Wildlife-Origin Virus Outbreak

This project is a **portfolio simulation**, designed to showcase how I would architect and implement a scalable, secure, AWS cloud-native solution in response to a **wildlife-origin virus outbreak** with potential human spillover.

It demonstrates my experience in:

- Creating clear architectural documentation and artifacts to communicate with dev teams, analysts, and leadership
- Understanding and modeling business cases (e.g., opt-in human health data coordination)
- Selecting appropriate AWS services to fit the business requirements
- AWS solution design, development of CDK architecture and coding skills
- Integrating existing IoT devices to AWS ingestion and analytics pipelines.
- Applying security best practices with AWS services (IAM, Secrets Manager, IoT Core certificates, fine-grained access policies)
- Structuring infrastructure as reusable, maintainable code across multiple stacks

Everything in this project is fictional but grounded in real-world architecture patterns used in health, government, and research cloud systems.

# Scenario: Wildlife Health Surveillance Cloud Solution (WATCH)

**Wildlife Health Surveillance (WHS) Program**, is a fictional program dedicated to monitoring and detecting pathogens affecting wildlife populations, which can potentially spill over to humans, posing a significant public health risk. To facilitate this work, the WHS Program requires a robust and scalable IT solution for the genomic analysis of wildlife samples, storage of genomic sequence data, and sharing of results with various stakeholders, including wildlife health organizations, research institutions, and public health agencies.

## üìê Reference Architecture and Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/Reference_Architecture.png" alt="Reference Architecture Diagram" width="700"/>
</p>

This reference architecture presents a real-world context in which multiple independent entities are already collecting valuable data related to wildlife and public health. The primary focus of this project is to build the **WATCHHub** ‚Äî a centralized ingestion and coordination platform that enables secure, scalable, and unified access to data streams across all these sources.

<details>
<summary>1Ô∏è‚É£ Existing IoT Devices</summary>

- IoT sensors such as GPS collars, environmental monitors, health trackers, and camera traps are already deployed in the field and maintained by third-party contractors. These devices transmit telemetry data via satellite and are available for integration with centralized infrastructure.
</details>

<details>
<summary>2Ô∏è‚É£ Existing Field Scientists & Mobile Data Collection</summary>

- Field workers actively collect wildlife samples during on-site research. A **React-based mobile application**, equipped with offline storage, allows them to digitize metadata and field observations, which are later synced to the cloud.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3Ô∏è‚É£ WATCHHub (Project Focus)</summary>

- The core focus of this project is to build the **Wildlife Analysis and Technology Center for Health Hub (WATCHHub)** ‚Äî a cloud-native ingestion platform that centralizes data from all external sources. WATCHHub standardizes data, enforces security and compliance, and provides shared access for stakeholders such as researchers, public health officials, and partner organizations. It is designed to support workshops and collaboration across technical and non-technical teams.
</details>

<details>
<summary>4Ô∏è‚É£ Existing Lab Clinics & Human Health Data</summary>

- Lab clinics operating near potential outbreak zones collect opt-in health data from donors. These clinics already manage biosample digitization and local data storage but require secure onboarding into a unified system for integrated analysis alongside wildlife data.
</details>

# Data Analytics & Visualization Using MetaBase (Examples)

## Wildlife Health Insights Dashboard

This Metabase dashboard provides a live overview of environmental and physiological data collected from wildlife via IoT sensors. The goal is to correlate GPS-tracked movement data with biometric health metrics to assess environmental stressors and animal activity.

**Key Features:**
- **Environmental Map** showing static sensor locations  
- **GPS Trail Map** visualizing animal movement paths  
- **Refined GPS Table** with timestamped coordinate data  
- **Activity Level Bar Chart** displaying average activity per sensor  

These tools support spatial and temporal analysis of wildlife health data, enabling researchers and biologists to track changes in animal behavior in near real-time.

## Camera Trap Data + Collar Data

This visualization demonstrates the fusion of camera trap imagery with IoT-derived biometric data from a GPS collar sensor. By combining visual evidence of animal presence with real-time physiological metrics, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the animal‚Äôs health, behavior, and environmental conditions at the time of capture.

## 1 IoT Device Simulation Architecture ##

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/IoT_simulation.png" alt="IoT Simulation Diagram" width="700"/>
</p>

In the real world, IoT devices would transmit telemetry data via satellite to a centralized platform. This simulation replicates that process using the following AWS services and components founr in the `EcrStack` and `EcsStack`:

- **Amazon ECR**: Hosts container images for each simulated IoT device (e.g., GPS collars, environmental sensors), each containing a Python script.
- **Amazon ECS**: Orchestrates the deployment of containers by defining task configurations for each device type.
- **AWS Fargate**: Runs the ECS tasks as serverless containers, allowing each simulated device to execute independently without managing infrastructure.
- **JSON Payloads**: Python scripts inside each container generate structured JSON telemetry data that mimics real-world IoT device output.
- **MQTT Protocol**: Simulated telemetry is streamed using the MQTT protocol, replicating how real devices transmit data over low-bandwidth networks.
- **AWS IoT Core (Downstream Hub)**: Acts as the simulated cloud ingestion point where data would be routed in a production setting for processing, storage, and analysis.
